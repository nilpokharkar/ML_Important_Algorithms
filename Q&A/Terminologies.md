1. What is generalization capability?
- To use different sets of data for training and testing to see how well the model performs on samples it never meets.
2. What is adversarial learning?
- The training process where the two models try to weaken each other and, as a result, improve each other is called adversarial learning.
3. The **transposed convolution layer** can be considered as the reverse process of a normal convolution.
4. Batch_Size: Impacts on how much **Memory you code** will consume.
5. Epochs: Impact on the training time of the NN. For betterresults, use greater number of epochs and small learning rate.
