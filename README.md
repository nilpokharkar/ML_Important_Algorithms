Machine Learning Concepts and Algorithms


1. Supervised Learning
  - Classification (discrete)
    * Logistic Regression
    * Naive Bayes Classification
    * K-Nearest Neighbors
    * Support Vector Machine
    
  - Regression (continuous)
    * Linear Regression
    * Ridge Regression
    * Ordinary Least Square
    * Stepwise Regression
    
    
2. Unsupervised Learning
  - Clustering (discrete)
    * K-Means
    * K-Medians
    * Hierarchical clustering
    * Expection Maximization
    
  - Density Estimation (continuous)
  
  - Association Analysis
    * Apriori
    * Eclat
    * FP-Growth
    
  - Dimensionality Reduction
    * Feature Extarction - Principal Component Analysis
    * Feature Selection
      + Wrapper
      + Filter
      + Embedded Method
      
      
3. Reinforcement Learning
  - Model-Free
    * Q-Learning
    * Hybrid
    * Policy Optimization
    
  - Model-Based
    * Learn the model
    * Given the model
    
    
4. Semi-supervised Learning (same as supervised): sometime the relation is given or we have to come up with some relation.
