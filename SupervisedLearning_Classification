# Classification

## Code:
1.  from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
    import statsmodel.api #stats model implementataion of LinearRegression using OLS (ordinary least square)


## Logistic Regression

### Regression
 - Relates the dependent variable to one or more independent(explanatory) variables.
 - Captures the coorelation between the variables observed in the dataset and determines the statistical significance of that correlation.
 - Linear regression models often use a least-squares approach to determine the line of best fit. (having very low error or cost function)
 - Simple linear regression: Y=c+mX+error

Used For:
+ Prediction and Forecasting
+ Inferring relationships between the independent and dependent variables.

### Linear Regression
- Forms linear relationship of output variable with the independent input variables.
- Determines the statistical significance of correlation between the dependent/output and independent/input variable (if input variables does good job in prediction).
- Which independent variable more influences the prediction.

Assumptions:
1. Linear Relationship between dependent and independent variables. (Visualization: Scatterplot, Heatmap, pairplot)
2. Data must be normally distributed i.e. features or variables. (Visualization: Q-Q plot, Histogram,etc)
3. Low or no correlation between independent variables (multi-collinearity: correlation coefficient: +/-1.0). (Check using Variance Inflation Factor)
4. Mean of the observed value and predicted value must be closer to 0. (mean of residual)
5. Residual normally distributed.
6. Homoskedasticity, Variance of the residual throughout the data should be same.
7. There should be little or no Auto-Correlation is the data. Auto-Correlation Occurs when the residuals are not independent of each other.This usally takes place in time series analysis.

COst/Loss function:
1. Mean Squared Error 
2. Root Mean squared error
Loss function = 1/n*sum(square(pred - y))
